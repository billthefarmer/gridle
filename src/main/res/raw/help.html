<h1>Gridle</h1>
<h2>Guess those words</h2>
<p>
  Move letters in the grid to make a gridle of words. It's a good idea
  to use a soft tipped stylus to see what you are doing, as it's
  difficult to see past stubby fingers.
</p>
<h2>Display colours</h2>
<p>
  Letters which are in the word but in the wrong place will turn
  yellow. Remember this can be in both directions. If they are in the
  right place they will turn green. If they are not in the word they
  will turn grey. Keep trying until you have guessed all the
  words. The colours may be changed by selecting
  <b>Highlight colours</b> in the menu.
</p>
<h2>Refresh</h2>
<p>
  Tap the <b>Refresh</b> button in the toolbar to clear the display
  and generate another gridle of words. Words are chosen at random from
  a list, and are checked that they haven't been used recently.
</p>
<h2>Share</h2>
<p>
  Tap the <b>Share</b> button in the toolbar to share an image of the
  current display.
</p>
<h2>Large</h2>
<p>
  Solve a larger 7x7 grid of words. This will show an initial blank
  grid and rotating symbol while the larger puzzle is
  created. Similarly, tapping the refresh button will not create a
  new puzzle immediately.
</p>
<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>
  Select coloured theme from the <b>Theme</b> item in the menu.
</p>
<h2>Highlight colours</h2>
<p>
  A dialog will pop up showing two guesses, one containing some
  letters in the word in the wrong place and a correct guess, and two
  spectrums. Change the colour of the letters in the wrong place by
  tapping on the top spectrum, and the correct letters with the bottom
  spectrum.  The <b>Reset</b> button will restore the default colours,
  The <b>Cancel</b> button changes nothing, and the <b>OK</b> button
  accepts the changes.
