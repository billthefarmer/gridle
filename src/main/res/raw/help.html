<h1>Gridle</h1>
<h2>Guess those words</h2>
<p>
  Move letters in the grid to make a gridle of words. It's a good idea
  to use a soft tipped stylus to see what you are doing, as it's
  difficult to see past stubby fingers.
</p>
<h2>Display colours</h2>
<p>
  Letters which are in the word but in the wrong place will turn
  yellow. Remember this can be in both directions. If they are in the
  right place they will turn green. If they are not in the word they
  will turn grey. Keep trying until you have guessed all the
  words. The colours may be changed by selecting
  <b>Highlight colours</b> in the menu.
</p>
<h2>Refresh</h2>
<p>
  Tap the <b>Refresh</b> button in the toolbar to clear the display
  and generate another gridle of words. Words are chosen at random from
  a list, and are checked that they haven't been used recently.
</p>
<h2>Share</h2>
<h3>Image</h3>
<p>
  Share an image of the current display.
</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>
  Display an alphanumeric code and a QR code which represents a new
  sequence of words to guess. This code may be shared with another
  copy of Gurgle on another phone to set the same sequence of
  words. Tapping the QR code button on the dialog shares the QR code
  image. Tapping the code button shares the alphanumeric code.
</p>
<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>
  Select coloured theme from the <b>Theme</b> item in the menu.
</p>
<h2>Language</h2>
<p>
  Select <b>Language</b> from the menu.
</p>
<h2>Get code</h2>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>
  Enter the code shared by another copy of Gurgle to set the same
  sequence of words. If a game is in progress tap the refresh button
  to start the new sequence. You may also make up your own code. It
  doesn't need the two equals symbols on the end (=), but will fail
  with just one.
</p>
<h3>QR code</h3>
<p>
  Opens the camera app on the phone to take a photo of a QR code. The
  app will attempt to decode it. There are plenty of very good QR code
  and barcode scanner apps that do a better job.
</p>
<h3>Receiving a code</h3>
<p>
  If the app is sent a code or a QR code image it will set a new
  sequence of words if the code is decoded successfully. This does not
  affect the current game. If a game is in progress tap the refresh
  button to start the new sequence.
</p>

<h2>Highlight colours</h2>
<p>
  A dialog will pop up showing two guesses, one containing some
  letters in the word in the wrong place and a correct guess, and two
  spectrums. Change the colour of the letters in the wrong place by
  tapping on the top spectrum, and the correct letters with the bottom
  spectrum.  The <b>Reset</b> button will restore the default colours,
  The <b>Cancel</b> button changes nothing, and the <b>OK</b> button
  accepts the changes.
</p>
